# NYCU2025 Deep Learning course
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning and recently receive a lot of attention due to its state-of-the art performance. Deep learning has been applied extensively to many areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and wireless networks. In this course, we will introduce various deep learning architectures and techniques, and discuss the advances in this area through paper presentation. Students have the chance to practice implementing deep learning by doing programming homework and applying deep learning to real problems by doing final project.

## HW1 - Build deep neural network on my own
Build a deep neural network model by using the back propagation and SGD algorithm for **Regression and Classification**

## HW2 - Image Recognition
1. Using Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition
- Implement a CNN for image recognition using the **MNIST dataset**.
- Analyze the effect of different stride size and filter size
- Plot the learning curve, accuracy of training and test sets, and distributions of weights and biases
- Add L2 regularization to the CNN implemented above and discuss its effect
2. Preprocessing Before Using Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition
- This is similar to `1.` but using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. Since this dataset **hasn’t been processed beforehand**, so I describe the preprocessing in my report `2-5 preprocessing.pdf`.

## HW3 - RNN / RNN with LSTM
1.  Construct a **standard RNN** then show  (1) network architecture, (2) learning curve, (3) training error rate and (4) validation error rate.
2. Choose 5 breakpoints during your training process to show how well your network learns through more epochs. Feed some part of your training text into RNN and show the text output.
3. Compare the results of choosing different sizes of hidden states and sequence length by plotting the training loss vs. different parameters.
4. **Construct another RNN with LSTM** then redo 1. to 3. Also discuss the difference of the results between standard RNN and LSTM.

## Paper Presentation - "Attention is all you need"
- My presentation report is in `Attention is all you need.pdf`
